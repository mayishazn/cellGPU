//!Implement a 2D active vertex model, using kernels in \ref avmKernels
/*!
A class that implements a simple active vertex model in 2D. This involves calculating forces on
vertices, moving them around, and updating the topology of the cells according to some criteria.

This class is a child of the vertexModelBase class, which provides data structures like the positions of
cells, vertex positions, indices of vertices around each cell, cells around each vertex, etc.
updates/enforces the topology according to vertexModelBase' T1 functions
